# Building a Serverless Email Marketing Application with AWS

Welcome to my comprehensive guide on creating a serverless email marketing application using AWS services. This project harnesses the power of AWS Lambda, SES, S3, EventBridge, and IAM to automate personalized email campaigns efficiently.

## Project Overview

This project aims to simplify the process of sending personalized marketing emails using serverless architecture, ensuring scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Project Structure

```
serverless-email-marketing-application/
│
├── email_template.html       # HTML email template for personalized emails
├── contacts.csv              # CSV file containing contact information
├── lambda_function.py        # Python code for the Lambda function to send emails
└── lambda_policy.json        # IAM policy defining permissions for Lambda
```

## AWS Services Used

- **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)**: Secure and reliable email sending service.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing for executing email sending logic.
- **Amazon S3**: Storage for email templates and contact lists.
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Event-driven service for scheduling email tasks.
- **AWS IAM**: Management of permissions for Lambda and other AWS resources.

## Requirements

To replicate this project, you'll need:

- Valid email addresses to send marketing emails.
- An email address from your domain authorized for SES.
- Basic knowledge of AWS to configure services.
- A text editor to customize HTML email templates.

## Step-by-Step Guide

# 1. Setting Up S3 Bucket

I created an S3 bucket (`my-email-marketing-bucket`) to store `email_template.html` and `contacts.csv`.

# 2. Uploading Files to S3

Using AWS Management Console, I uploaded `email_template.html` and `contacts.csv` to S3 for easy access.

### 3. Configuring Amazon SES

Verified my domain and email address with Amazon SES to ensure reliable email delivery and prevent spam filtering.

### 4. Creating Lambda Function

Developed a Python Lambda function (`lambda_function.py`) to process each contact from `contacts.csv`, merge their details into `email_template.html`, and send personalized emails via SES.

### 5. IAM Role Configuration

Created an IAM role (`lambda_policy.json`) allowing Lambda access to S3 for templates and contacts, and SES for sending emails.

### 6. Setting Up EventBridge

Configured Amazon EventBridge to schedule Lambda invocations, automating email sends at specific times for effective campaign management.

### 7. Testing and Validation

Thoroughly tested the system by sending test emails, ensuring correct formatting (`email_template.html`) and verifying IAM permissions and Lambda configurations.
