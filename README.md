# Serverless Email Marketing Application

Welcome to my step-by-step guide on building a serverless email marketing application using AWS services.

# Project Structure

```
serverless-email-marketing-application/
│
├── email_template.html       # HTML email template used for sending emails
├── contacts.csv              # CSV file containing contact information
├── lambda_function.py        # Python code for the Lambda function to send personalized emails
└── lambda_policy.json        # IAM policy for the Lambda execution role
```
# Services Used

- **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)**: For sending emails securely and reliably.
- **AWS Lambda**: To execute the email sending logic without managing servers.
- **Amazon S3**: For storing email templates and contact lists.
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Used for scheduling and triggering email sending tasks.
- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: To manage permissions for Lambda functions and other AWS resources.

# Requirements

- Valid email addresses to send to.
- An email address from your own domain to send from.
- Basic knowledge of AWS to set up and configure the services.
- A text editor for editing HTML code for email templates.

# Steps I Followed

# 1. Created an S3 Bucket

I set up an S3 bucket named `my-email-marketing-bucket` to store my email templates (`email_template.html`) and contact list (`contacts.csv`).

# 2. Uploaded Files to S3

Using the AWS Management Console, I uploaded `email_template.html` and `contacts.csv` to my S3 bucket for easy access and management.

# 3. Set Up Amazon SES

I verified my domain and email address with Amazon SES to ensure emails were sent securely and to avoid being marked as spam. Moving SES out of the sandbox was essential for production-level email campaigns.

# 4. Created the Lambda Function

Using AWS Lambda, I developed a Python function (`lambda_function.py`) that processes each contact from `contacts.csv`, merges their details into the `email_template.html`, and sends personalized emails using SES.

# 5. Configured Lambda Execution Role

To enable Lambda to interact with SES and S3, I created an IAM role (`lambda_policy.json`) with the necessary permissions. This role allowed Lambda to access S3 for templates and contacts and send emails via SES.

# 6. Set Up EventBridge for Scheduled Emails

To automate email sending, I utilized Amazon EventBridge to schedule Lambda function invocations at specific times. This setup ensured timely delivery of marketing emails without manual intervention.

# 7. Testing and Validation

Before launching the email campaign, I conducted extensive testing. This involved sending test emails to verify delivery and formatting (`email_template.html`). I also checked IAM permissions and Lambda configurations to ensure everything was set up correctly for production.
