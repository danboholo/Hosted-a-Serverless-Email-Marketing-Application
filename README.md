# Building a Serverless Email Marketing Application with AWS

Welcome to my comprehensive guide on creating a serverless email marketing application using AWS services. This project harnesses the power of AWS Lambda, SES, S3, EventBridge, and IAM to automate personalized email campaigns efficiently.

## Project Overview

This project aims to simplify the process of sending personalized marketing emails using serverless architecture, ensuring scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Project Structure

```
serverless-email-marketing-application/
│
├── email_template.html       # HTML email template for personalized emails
├── contacts.csv              # CSV file containing contact information
├── lambda_function.py        # Python code for the Lambda function to send emails
└── lambda_policy.json        # IAM policy defining permissions for Lambda
```

## AWS Services Used

- **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)**: Secure and reliable email sending service.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing for executing email sending logic.
- **Amazon S3**: Storage for email templates and contact lists.
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Event-driven service for scheduling email tasks.
- **AWS IAM**: Management of permissions for Lambda and other AWS resources.

## Requirements

To replicate this project, you'll need:

- Valid email addresses to send marketing emails.
- An email address from your domain authorized for SES.
- Basic knowledge of AWS to configure services.
- A text editor to customize HTML email templates.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Setting Up S3 Bucket
Create an S3 bucket (my-email-marketing-bucket) to store email_template.html and contacts.csv. Ensure the bucket is private and only accessible by authorized IAM roles.

2. Uploading Files to S3
Use the AWS Management Console to upload email_template.html and contacts.csv to S3. Apply appropriate bucket policies to restrict access.

3. Configuring Amazon SES
Verify your domain and email address with Amazon SES to ensure reliable email delivery and prevent spam filtering. Monitor SES sending quotas and activity.

4. Creating Lambda Function
Develop a Python Lambda function (lambda_function.py) to process each contact from contacts.csv, merge their details into email_template.html, and send personalized emails via SES. Follow secure coding practices and avoid hardcoding sensitive information.

5. IAM Role Configuration
Create an IAM role (lambda_policy.json) with the least privilege principle, allowing Lambda access to S3 for templates and contacts, and SES for sending emails. Regularly review and audit IAM policies.

6. Setting Up EventBridge
Configure Amazon EventBridge to schedule Lambda invocations, automating email sends at specific times for effective campaign management. Monitor and log event activity.

7. Testing and Validation
Thoroughly test the system by sending test emails, ensuring correct formatting (email_template.html) and verifying IAM permissions and Lambda configurations. Perform security tests and validate encryption of sensitive data.
